# YOLOv5-Object-Detection-Model
YOLOv5 Object Detection Model
he notebook appears to be focused on setting up and training a YOLOv5 model for object detection, potentially for a custom dataset related to road conditions or other object recognition tasks. Here’s a breakdown of its main components:

YOLOv5 Cloning and Setup:

The notebook clones the YOLOv5 repository from GitHub to access its object detection framework and scripts.
It installs required dependencies for YOLOv5 and an additional library, Roboflow, for dataset management.
Roboflow Integration:

Roboflow is used to load a specific dataset from a workspace, which is set up using an API key. The dataset is downloaded in a format compatible with YOLOv5.
Model Training:

YOLOv5’s train.py script is utilized to train the model, specifying parameters like image size (640 pixels), the number of epochs (120), and a path to the dataset YAML file that configures training and validation data.
